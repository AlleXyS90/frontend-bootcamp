# Shop Application

The scope of this project is to go through the basics of Angular. Its scope is to go through the main chapters of angular (components, directives, pipes, routing, modules, services, guards, etc) via examples.   

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
